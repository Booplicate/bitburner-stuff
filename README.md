# Collection of useful scripts

### Usage
- Compile the scripts into vanila Javascript (`tsc` should do, but you can use advanced tools like auto-compiler)
- Move the entire `code/` folder
- Run the scripts using `run`, e.g. `run code/hack-manager.js`

### Scripts
- `nuke.js` - nukes (hacks) a server, hacks all available ports if possible
- `server-manager.js` - a util script to buy/upgrade/retrieve owned servers
- `hack-manager.js` - starts a manager that will control the hacking process of available servers,
the manager will use all available servers as well as purchased servers to run the scripts
